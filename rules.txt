2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid.
Initially there will be 2 tiles of either 2 or 4.
And every turn a new tile will appear randomly in the grid.
Enter 'W'(↑),'S'(↓),'A'(←) or 'D'(→) to move the tiles.
Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
Add them up to reach 2048!

Friendly reminders:
You can pause at any time during the game:
Just enter everything except the direction key!
You may also encounter questions ended with (Y/*):
Just enter 'Y' for yes, and everything else for no.
Also remember that all the keys are case-insensitive.

Enjoy!
