2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid.
Initially there will be 2 tiles of either 2 or 4.
And every turn a new tile will appear randomly in the grid.
Enter 'W'(↑),'S'(↓),'A'(←) or 'D'(→) to move the tiles.
Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
Add them up to reach 2048!

Friendly reminders:
1.  You can undo your previous move unlimitedly by entering 'U'!
2.  You can pause at any time during the game:
    Just enter everything except the direction key and the 'U'!
3.  You can also save your progress of the game.
    But remember: once you save your game, undo is no longer possible.
    Plus, a limit of 1 record can be saved: new saving will overwrite the old one.
4.  When you encounter questions ended with (Y/*):
    Just enter 'Y' for yes, and everything else for no.
5.  All the keys are case-insensitive.
